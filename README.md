# The Company

The Company is a Lethal Company mod that changes gameplay. In the early stages of development, it will be relatively minor, but as I update it, it will expand.

## Features

* A moral guidence system, to always make you remember to be a great great asset...

* A new system for gameplay (coming soon)

* It also allows you to explode :)

## Configs

Currently the only config inside the mod is to enable or disable god, but it is currently unused. More will be implemented in the future though!

## Mod Support

Currently, I have no plans to add support for other mods but if you have ideas for it, feel free to open an issuel.
